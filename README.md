## Running Locally

- Clone the repo
- Use `rbenv` to choose ruby `2.3.3`
- `gem install bundler`
- `git submodule init && git submodule update` to install the submodules
- `rake serve` to start the local server on port 4000.


## Forking to your GitHub
If you've forked the repo, you'll need to make sure github.io is turned on, and that you've chosen a theme. A push will trigger GitHub to build the jekyll site.
